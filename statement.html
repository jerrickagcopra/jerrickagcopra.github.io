  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am a Digital Media Artist. My practice concerns the digital and technological aspects of artistic expression. Despite being in the field, I am naturally inclined to digital art where I find my influences in animation, comics, Anime, etc. It is my wish to present my views and express myself in digital paintings as well as do a little bit of work in digital video and sound.
  </p>
  <p>I am a drawer as well as a gamer. It might just be the kid inside of me that draws me to it. I don't explore any one theme when it comes to my work. What comes to my mind is what I get and I put my mind to it until it's finished. I seldom like being tied down and represented by a single word in my works. I like to branch out and explore different things to develop a more creative mind.
