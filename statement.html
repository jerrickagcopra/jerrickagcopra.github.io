  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am a Digital Media Artist. My practice concerns the digital and technological aspects of artistic expression. Despite being in the field, I am naturally inclined to digital art where I find my influences in animation. It is my wish to present my views and express myself in digital paintings as well as do a little of work in digital video and sound.
